### Vim Configs

![vim config](https://github.com/Matsadura/ALX_Time_Saver/assets/132571698/b438e9c2-2d0b-4e76-9a42-48f0bb11b40f)

The numbers are handy for jumping between lines without counting them.

#### Compiling with F5
To compile the current file by pressing F5, the file must be in this format: "number"-"name".c (e.g., `0-putchar.c`), and there should be a test file usually named "number"-main.c (e.g., `0-main.c`). If the test file doesn't exist, use the `compile` command instead.

![VIM F5 Showcase](https://github.com/Matsadura/ALX_Time_Saver/assets/132571698/46ecc108-9288-4f7f-a5b2-b5302f251348)

#### Betty with F2
Press F2 in Vim instead of leaving it to run "betty file_name.c" separately.

![Betty](https://github.com/Matsadura/ALX_Time_Saver/assets/132571698/ccb022bf-b0fa-4089-bfdb-2fa061632744)

#### Remove Whitespace with F4
Whitespace is highlighted in red.

CD to ALX-Time-Saver and launch the script with `./read_maker.py`. Enter the repo name, project's subdirectory, and make sure everything you need is pushed to GitHub. The script generates markdown for your `README.md`.

![readmaker_demo](https://github.com/Matsadura/ALX_Time_Saver/assets/132571698/6414f3c2-4133-42fb-add0-2439154f1071)

Clicking on a file opens it (on GitHub).

### All-in-One Maker
Run the script with `mkfiles`, and the new files will be in your chosen location.
