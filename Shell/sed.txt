sed replace a chosen word and replace it with another
example
i created i txt file named sedtest
with this text inside of it
     "The fly flies like no fly flies.
     A fly is an insect that has wongs and a fly likes to eat leftovers."

and i runed this command
     sed 's/fly/grasshopper/g' sedtest.txt
this command replaced every word 'fly' with 'grasshopper' in sedtest.txt

another command like it is
	 sed -i.ORIGINAL 's/fly/grasshopper/g' sedtest.txt
this command replaced every word 'fly' with 'grasshopper' in sedtest.txt
and created a backfile named sedtest.txt.ORIGINAL (or what ever you want) with the original text.
